# KBert-En
The [origin code of K-Bert](https://github.com/autoliuweijie/K-BERT) has just Implemented on Chinese dataset and not compatible with English dataset.

I modified some code of K-BERT so that it can be fit to English datasets  Topics Resources

I run the code in a classification task, If you want run with other task, just copy the 'barin/know_graph.py' file.
